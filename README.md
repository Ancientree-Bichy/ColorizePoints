# How to Add Color onto LiDAR Points

This small project shows a simple way to colorize the LiDAR points with a paired camera image.

Code is provided in the [Python notebook](https://github.com/Ancientree-Bichy/ColorizePoints/blob/master/colorize_kitti.ipynb), with a set of paired image and point cloud from the [KITTI Dataset](https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/) for demonstration.
